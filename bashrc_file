# .bashrc

## add executables for tba & lastz in the path
## warning: TBA needs an executable blastz in its path
## blastz is deprecated, lastz has replaced blastz...
## lastz and blastz work the same way, some bugs have been solved in lastz compared to blastz
## trick: I copied the lastz executable and renamed it "blastz", so TBA uses lastz in my configuration
